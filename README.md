# Image_Analyzer
This Python script, image_analyzer.py, is a versatile tool designed to analyze images and text documents within a specified folder. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) through the Ollama framework to extract meaningful information, mirror document layouts, and provide both terminal output and structured document generation.
